      <h1>My daughter's first art</h1>
      <p>My daughter is 4 years old, and this is her first time making art digitally. She has a lot of earlier experience
        with colored pencils and paper, but now she wanted to challenge herself. It is - in her opinion, not as
        fun on paper, since it limits the possibilities for interaction.</p>

      <p>This art is a combination of her favorite colors and shapes. Each shape and its color has a reason for being
      included in her art. The piece "Safe, Venturous Globe" symbolizes her experience of her first couple of years in life.
      Her second piece "Not a blank canvas anymore" represents how she sees the world now that she has grown up a little more.
      As she becomes older, she has to act more like a grown up, hence the removal of the gradient coloring.</p>

      <p>She is on the stepping stones of becoming a new Picasso or DaVinci. In a couple of years,
      these art pieces will be in museums.</p>

      <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>

      <p>In this project CSS Flexbox has been used to make a sensible and responsive layout on the website.
        Elements that are to be placed next to each other horizontally, are placed in the same container,
        which is then manipulated with “display: flex” and “flex-direction: row”, so that the layout wanted was achieved.
        The artwork and the titles of the art are placed in one container each, and as seen on the website,
        they appear alongside each other.

      <p>The rest of the layout is decided by the basic box model from CSS.
        Since the other elements only needed to be placed on top of each other, vertically,
        there was no need to use CSS Flexbox. When basing the rest of the layout on the basic CSS box model,
        the containers of the art and titles are behaving like the element to be placed vertically,
        not the elements within the container.</p>

        <h2>HTML Canvas and SVG in HTML</h2>

        <p>The shapes and figures in SVG were computed in HTML by specifying the coordinates,
          heights, widths and so on. Some of them have styling in CSS as well. In SVG in HTML,
          each figure is treated like an object. They have their own ID and their own attributes.
          This made it easy to interact with the figures, because you can make a happening to be
          associated with an object. </p>

        <p>With HTML Canvas, on the other hand, the Canvas is only a container where you can draw
          elements by specifying coordinates. The elements in the artwork each have their own draw
          function in JavaScript which draws them by using paths, but they have no ID or attributes.
          Colors and strokes are added by specifying fillStyle() and strokeStyle().
          To add functionality to a single element, one would have to manually match the coordinates
          of the pointer with the coordinates of the drawn figure.
          This made it difficult to make i.e. a click function to only interact
          with a specified element. Therefore all the interaction with the artwork made in HTML Canvas
          happens to the entire container, and are not limited to the figures drawn. </p>

        <h2>jQuery</h2>

        <p>jQuery has been used to add functionality and interactivity to the two pieces of art.
          With the figures in SVG, a function is associated with that element only using selectors.
          They are triggered by different events like hover, click or double click, and they cause
          different actions like color change, hide, show etc.</p>

        <p>With the Canvas art, the selector of the functions is always the entire canvas container.
        Different events still trigger different actions, but the events are not limited to happen in a specified
        area or on a specified element in the canvas. Within the jQuery functions, basic JavaScript is used to make
        it seem like it is only one element that is triggered, by drawing a new figure on top of the other in another color.</p>

        <h2>Cross-browser testing</h2>

        <p>For this project, the cross-browser testing was executed on Google Chrome and Safari.
        There was minimal noticeable difference, and all the interaction and functionality behaves
        like it should in both browsers.</p>
